# SpreadSheet-in-JavaScript


freeCodeCamp Practice Project.


JavaScript Algorithims and Data Structures.



Functional Programming is a popular approach to software development. In Functional Programming, developers organize code into smaller functions, then combine those functions to build complex programs.

In this spreadsheet application project, I learnt about parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions, implementing spreadsheet functions, handling cell references, and creating interactive web interfaces. I learnt how to dynamically update the page based on user input.

This project covers concepts like the map(), find(), and includes() methods and the parseInt() function.
